## UW-Richland - Java (droppeg it)

- Of all the classes, this was the one I couldn't skate through. I was struggling to maintain a passing grade, and I was afraid a low score in the class would bring my grades down--so I dropped the class and stuck to the business, economics, and speech classes which all felt, well, easier.
